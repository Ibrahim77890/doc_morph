Use platform enablers, APIs, and data sources as a baseline of functionality to support \ntailored solutions.  \n \nNOTE  To understand how industry and business requirements link to the underlying technologies \nthat support them, review the  Reference Architecture for Consumer Goods . Use the industry \nblueprint as a framework for creating a reference architecture for planning customer experience \nenhancements.  \n \n \nReference Architecture for Consumer \nGoods  \nMap specific Salesforce products to the functional capabilities and operational activities of consumer \ngoods organizations.  \nSalesforce provides configurable product solutions that support a consumer goods company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \neffectively engage their customers and partners. The reference architecture helps communicate the vision \nand strategy of a solution to business executives  and stakeholders.  Learn with Trailhead . Our reference architecture presents Functional and Platform capabilities. Each layer contains a \nrepresentative subset of systems or capabilities that are most relevant for consumer goods organizations. \nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t list all possible systems or capabilities.  \n[IMAGE]  \n \nPlatform Capabilities  \nThese components form the underlying technology base for achieving your goals. Each layer in the \nplatform builds on top of the next. B2B systems typically rely on these elements.  \nCAPABILITY  DESCRIPTION  \nData Sources  Data sources are systems that create, collect, and manage various types of data. These systems can \nact as systems of record. They\xe2\x80\x99re often purpose -built to handle particular functionality and data \nrequirements, but some provide general system needs.  \nIntegrations  Integrations include tools and routes that connect systems of record with each other or with higher -\nlevel experiences. Integrations can include varied tools like APIs that connect separate systems, single \nsign-on services to manage customer identity across different systems, and custome r data platforms \nthat segment customers.  \nIntelligence  Smart automation like machine learning and AI helps you optimize your use of customer data. To \nenhance your customer relationships and drive sales, the intelligence layer serves functions like \ndelivering actionable customer insights, personalized product r ecommendations, and improving real -\ntime customer interactions.  \nAnalytics  Analytics helps you better understand your data and make smart business decisions.  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Descriptive analytics summarize existing data to help you better understand the current state \nor past activities. Descriptive analytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your data.  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Diagnostic analytics use the output of descriptive analytics to identify patterns and outlier \ndata. Diagnostic analytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your data.  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Predictive analytics use historical data to anticipate future outcomes, such as the likelihood \nthat a subscriber opens an email.  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prescriptive analytics suggest courses of action based on your existing data. Prescriptive \nanalytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cShould?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your future actions.  \nPlatform Enablers  Use common capabilities that drive the business processes across the enterprise. Build a unified \nprofile using a customer data platform. Drive workflows and engagement based on that unified \nprofile.  \nFunctional Capabilities  \nBusiness -specific elements at the functional capabilities level are connected more directly to the \ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s experience and measured in terms of maturity. Successful implementation of functional \ncapabilities depends heavily on implementation of the platfo rm capabilities.  \nThe consumer goods industry is evolving to handle disruption and change. The traditional integrated \nroute to markets focused the B2B business model on key account management and field retail execution \nvia sales channels. The industry is now starting to eng age end -consumers directly via B2C Commerce and \nself-service models in partner systems. The recent evolution of privacy is also driving marketing changes \nto understand consumer behavior more directly by gathering more first -party data.  \nTo identify strategic goals around which to focus your implementation, review common B2C  Business \nScenarios for Retail  and their included functional capabilities.  \nA Business Capability Maturity Assessment arranged by your Success Manager or Account Executive can \nhelp you determine which areas of your business can benefit from more focus.  \nMapping Platform Capabilities to Salesforce  \n[IMAGE]  \n  \n \nSpecific Salesforce products handle each of the needs identified at the platform capability level.  \nIdentify gaps in your underlying capabilities by customizing this model to include other Salesforce \nproducts or third -party systems in your current technology stack.  \nTo explore the reference architecture specific to your business, contact your Success Manager or Account \nTeam.  \nBusiness Scenarios for Consumer Goods  help you better understand your business capabilities and find \nsolutions that support your business goals.  \nLearn more about Salesforce products in this industry.  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Consumer Goods Cloud  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 CPQ  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mulesoft  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Commerce  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Experience Cloud  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Service  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Field Service  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sales  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Analytics  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Work.com  \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Marketing  \n \n \nBusiness Capabilities for Manage Key \nAccounts  \nGet a detailed view of maturity levels, best practices, and recommended solutions for enhancing \nsales capabilities for consumer goods organizations.  \nUse maturity levels to determine your organization\xe2\x80\x99s progress in each capability area.
