NOTE  To understand which business capabilities, solutions, and Salesforce products can help your organization achieve the business needs identified on the blueprint, review the  Business Scenarios for Consumer Goods .
Platform Enablers, API, and Data Sources are common across all lifecycle stages and business processes.
Use platform enablers, APIs, and data sources as a baseline of functionality to support tailored solutions.
NOTE  To understand how industry and business requirements link to the underlying technologies that support them, review the  Reference Architecture for Consumer Goods .
Use the industry blueprint as a framework for creating a reference architecture for planning customer experience enhancements.
Reference Architecture for Consumer Goods  Map specific Salesforce products to the functional capabilities and operational activities of consumer goods organizations.
Salesforce provides configurable product solutions that support a consumer goods company's ability to effectively engage their customers and partners.
The reference architecture helps communicate the vision and strategy of a solution to business executives  and stakeholders.
Learn with Trailhead .
Our reference architecture presents Functional and Platform capabilities.
Each layer contains a representative subset of systems or capabilities that are most relevant for consumer goods organizations.
It doesn't list all possible systems or capabilities.
http://res.cloudinary.com/dl5hzmrcz/image/upload/v1722341525/uobqyysx5yguhqeov7zc.png   Platform Capabilities  These components form the underlying technology base for achieving your goals.
Each layer in the platform builds on top of the next.
B2B systems typically rely on these elements.
CAPABILITY  DESCRIPTION  Data Sources  Data sources are systems that create, collect, and manage various types of data.
These systems can act as systems of record.
They're often purpose -built to handle particular functionality and data requirements, but some provide general system needs.
Integrations  Integrations include tools and routes that connect systems of record with each other or with higher -level experiences.
Integrations can include varied tools like APIs that connect separate systems, single sign-on services to manage customer identity across different systems, and custome r data platforms that segment customers.
Intelligence  Smart automation like machine learning and AI helps you optimize your use of customer data.
To enhance your customer relationships and drive sales, the intelligence layer serves functions like delivering actionable customer insights, personalized product r ecommendations, and improving real -time customer interactions.
Analytics  Analytics helps you better understand your data and make smart business decisions.
\xe2\x80\xa2 Descriptive analytics summarize existing data to help you better understand the current state or past activities.
Descriptive analytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your data.
\xe2\x80\xa2 Diagnostic analytics use the output of descriptive analytics to identify patterns and outlier data.
Diagnostic analytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your data.
\xe2\x80\xa2 Predictive analytics use historical data to anticipate future outcomes, such as the likelihood that a subscriber opens an email.
\xe2\x80\xa2 Prescriptive analytics suggest courses of action based on your existing data.
Prescriptive analytics typically answer \xe2\x80\x9cShould?\xe2\x80\x9d questions about your future actions.
Platform Enablers  Use common capabilities that drive the business processes across the enterprise.
Build a unified profile using a customer data platform.
Drive workflows and engagement based on that unified profile.
Functional Capabilities  Business -specific elements at the functional capabilities level are connected more directly to the customer's experience and measured in terms of maturity.
Successful implementation of functional capabilities depends heavily on implementation of the platfo rm capabilities.
The consumer goods industry is evolving to handle disruption and change.
The traditional integrated route to markets focused the B2B business model on key account management and field retail execution via sales channels.
The industry is now starting to eng age end -consumers directly via B2C Commerce and self-service models in partner systems.
The recent evolution of privacy is also driving marketing changes to understand consumer behavior more directly by gathering more first -party data.
To identify strategic goals around which to focus your implementation, review common B2C  Business Scenarios for Retail  and their included functional capabilities.
A Business Capability Maturity Assessment arranged by your Success Manager or Account Executive can help you determine which areas of your business can benefit from more focus.
Mapping Platform Capabilities to Salesforce  http://res.cloudinary.com/dl5hzmrcz/image/upload/v1722341525/qaf8xlg7ueg67qex5uox.png     Specific Salesforce products handle each of the needs identified at the platform capability level.
Identify gaps in your underlying capabilities by customizing this model to include other Salesforce products or third -party systems in your current technology stack.
