# doc_morph
AI-powered Document Transformer to convert your raw documents including text and photos into meaningful headings based document which can further be used for embeddings

# Description
Here's a breakdown of the core functionalities:

Document Processing: Handling various document formats (PDF, Word, etc.), extracting text and images.
Text Analysis: Using OpenAI's language models to identify topics, generate headings, and determine paragraph boundaries.
Image Analysis: Utilizing image recognition APIs (like those from Google Cloud or Amazon) to classify image types (graphs, tables, photos) and extract relevant information.
Content Integration: Combining text and image insights to create a coherent and structured output.
Output Formatting: Generating a final text-based document with proper formatting.
Roadmap
Phase 1: Document Preprocessing
Document Conversion: Convert input documents into a standardized format (e.g., plain text or JSON).
Text Extraction: Extract text from the document using libraries like PDF.js or docx4js.
Image Extraction: Identify and extract images from the document.
Phase 2: Text Analysis
Tokenization: Break down the text into tokens (words or subwords).
Sentence Segmentation: Identify sentence boundaries.
Topic Modeling: Use OpenAI's language models to identify potential topics within the text.
Heading Generation: Generate headings based on topic information.
Paragraph Segmentation: Determine paragraph boundaries based on topic changes and text coherence.
Phase 3: Image Analysis
Image Classification: Use image recognition APIs to classify images into categories (graphs, tables, photos, etc.).
Image Description: For photos, consider using image captioning models to generate descriptive text.
Data Extraction: Extract data from graphs and tables using OCR or specialized libraries.
Phase 4: Content Integration
Text-Image Correlation: Match images to relevant paragraphs based on content.
Image Placement: Determine optimal positions for images within the text.
Content Refinement: Adjust text and image placement for better flow and readability.
Phase 5: Output Generation
Text Formatting: Apply formatting (headings, paragraphs, lists) to the text.
Image Integration: Insert images into the text at appropriate locations.
Document Creation: Generate the final output document in a desired format (e.g., plain text, HTML, Markdown).
Additional Considerations
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for document processing, API calls, and data manipulation.
Performance Optimization: Optimize code for efficiency, especially when handling large documents.
User Interface: Consider developing a user-friendly interface for uploading documents and viewing results.
Model Selection: Experiment with different OpenAI models to find the best fit for your task.
Continuous Improvement: Collect user feedback and iterate on the model to enhance performance.
By following this roadmap and leveraging the power of AI, you can build a valuable document simplification tool.
